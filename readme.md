THIS IS MY PROJECT
=================

this is a file for the README in IT266  
This mod consist of different ideas. It is a speed game where you try and be fast with the items that are given to you.

---

Here are the changes to the game:

    1. the Guns (5) grant you different movement improvements and debuffs:
        * machine gun makes you a really good turret  
        * just like bomber man --> you must stand still to fire a grenade --> you can jump to further the range of the grenades
        * rocket launcher --> just like in bomber man ds --> your range is amazing but you can only jump (realy high) --> you are prone to taking damage with jump and explosion
        * lighting gun --> you move really fast, so good luck tracking people to use the gun.
        *shot gun --> you move sorta fast, but it makes it hard to stop and aim well

    2. pick ups (5) have different effects that can help or hurt you!
        * small health pickups --> lowers max hp --> does not stack
        * small armor pickups --> lowers max amor --> does not stack
        * large health pickups --> small health regen
        * large armor pickups --> you become a glass cannon
        * machine gun ammo --> grant double damage for 3 seconds  

    3. your primary guns are you abilities are on different keys --> find them through the game.
        * your blaster is 1 and is weak just like Mega Man's Blaster --> but you are fastest when holding it
        * bomber man abilites are 2 and 3 (g and r luanchers)

    4. there is a start time and a stop time clock
        * click [ to begin the clock
        * click ] to stop the clock
